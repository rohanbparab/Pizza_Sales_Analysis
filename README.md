Pizza Sales Analysis – SQL Project

This is my first SQL project, where I performed an ad-hoc analysis on a pizza sales dataset.

The goal was to explore sales trends, pizza popularity, and pricing using basic to advanced SQL queries. This helped me practice various SQL concepts including filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of four main tables:

orders – order details with date and time

order_details – links orders to pizzas and quantities

pizzas – information on pizza size and pricing

pizza_types – names, categories, and ingredients

🔍 Key Insights
Top-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue

Most popular pizza sizes

Peak ordering hours

Category-wise sales performance


Feel free to check out the queries and insights in the SQL scripts. I’m open to feedback and suggestions—this is just the beginning!
